    <p>My HTML notes</p>
    <p>this document discribes the HTML Hyper Text Markup Language and what is
    made of :</p>
    <p>the <sub>html</sub> document is made essentially of <sup>elements</sup> composed of some text
        between <mark>start</mark> and close tags.
    <p>First thing to talk <strong>about</strong> is line breaks "br" between 
        greater and smaller signes</p>
    <p>Second thing is the paragraph tag "p" to seperate a paragraph with 
        a margin, and we usually use some extra tags in typography for example
        to "mark" a word or make it boldface with "strong" tag or italicize 
        with "em" tag. also scientists use subscript "sub" and superscript "sup"
        to move the text up or down the base line.
    </p>
